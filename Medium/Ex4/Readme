compilation:
make ARCHa=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-

chr_drv_ioctl.ko will be geberated...you have get this file to board



insert driver...

while testing

#define sample_ioctl_FILL_ZERO		_IO( sample_ioctl_MAGIC, 1 )

/* sample_ioctl_FILL_ZERO: to fill our character array with a character
   As we can see there is not data transfer. The moment
   our driver gets this command, it executes the following
   for loop
   	for(i=0; i<MAX_LENGTH; i++) char_device_buf[i] = c;
   where c is the character. This involves something to be 
   transfered from user to kernel
*/
#define sample_ioctl_FILL_CHAR		_IOW( sample_ioctl_MAGIC, 2, char )

/* sample_ioctl_SET_SIZE: to set the size of the character array */

#define sample_ioctl_SET_SIZE		_IOW( sample_ioctl_MAGIC, 3, uint )

/* sample_ioctl_GET_SIZE: to get the size of the character array */
#define sample_ioctl_GET_SIZE		_IOR( sample_ioctl_MAGIC, 4, uint )

#define sample_ioctl_MAX_CMDS		4


please use ioctl commands which are defined by driver
